# DIY Total Purchase
A customer in a DIY store purchasing five items.
Design  a console program that asks for the price  of each item, and then displays the sub-total of the sale (i.e ex-VAT price), the VAT component and the final total (i.e sub-total plus the VAT component).

Hint: remember the VAT is currently 20%.
