# Vehicle Costs

Design a console program that asks the user to enter the yearly costs for the following expenses incurred from operating his or her vehicle: fuel, insurance, loan payment, maintenace, oil and tyres.

The program should then display the total yearly cost of all these expenses followed by the average cost for one month of the year.
